# Vector Display Graphics Engine (vEdge)

## Overview

I decided to write the Lunar Lander game using the Simple Direct Media library version 2 (SDL v2).
In starting this I have had to write a game engine for these types of games and this repo was born.
Currently it only supports a 2D vector display as that is all that is requried by my Lunar Lander game.


### Technologies

* All development is in the 'C' programming language (C99).
* SDL v2 is used as the underlying game library.
* The numeric data type is float by default.
* CMake is the build tool.
* CTest is used for unit test.


### File Index

 * vmath.h / vmath.c - Vector 2D Mathematics Routines. 
 * vdraw.h / vdraw.c - Vector Primitive Rendering Functions.
 * vedge.h / vedge.c - Vector Display Graphics Engine (vEdge).
 * vfont.h / vfont.c - Vector Font (ASCII range 0x20 - 0x5F).
 * test-vmath.c - Vector Math Routines Unit Tests.
 * test-vedge.c - Vector Display Graphics Engine (vEdge) Unit Tests.
 * main.h - Test Application configuration.
 * main.c - Test Application main implementation.
 * CMakeLists.txt - CMake file.
 * README.md - You are looking at it.
